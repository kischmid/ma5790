# MA 5790 Final Project

This repo was created to hold the code and data files used for the final project in MA 5790: Predictive Modeling at Michigan Technological University. 

Project created by Katie Schmidt and Dana Paquet.

For this project, we are using the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance. The goal is to predict the grades of students in two subjects, math and Portuguese, given 30 predictors about the student and their family life.
