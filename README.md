# MA 5790 Final Project

## Project created by Katie Schmidt and Dana Paquet.

This repo was created to hold the code and data files used for the final project in MA 5790: Predictive Modeling at Michigan Technological University. 

For this project, we are using the [Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). The goal is to predict the grades of students in two subjects, math and Portuguese, given 30 predictors about the student and their family life.
